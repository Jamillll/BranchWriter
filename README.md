# BranchWriter
This is a text editor like notepad and wordpress, I plan to increase the amount of features with time hopefully including image support to give it additional functionality. I hope to be able to replace my use of microsoft word and google docs meaning I will likely need a way to convert between the file types as well.

TODO:<br>
    Create combobox for fontsize and font<br>
    Add the ability to create additional pages for text if needed<br>
    Create dark mode for text box that will switch background and text colours to black and white when closer<br>
    Option to change text colur<br>
    Image moving and resizing options<br>
    Actually figure out an underline button<br>
    <br>
  Cosmetic updates:<br>
    Make the scroll bar actually match everything else<br>
    Improve error messages<br>
    Improve the appearance of buttons on hover effects<br>
    Sound effects on clicks for example<br>
    Add a settings tab with a bunch of colour changing options and other options<br>
    Allow the user to pick a background image (and if they want it blurred) for the scrollviewer <br>
    <br>
  Farrrr future features:<br>
      Writing prediction software which will likely require some form of machine learning or smth idk-
