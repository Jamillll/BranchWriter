This is a text editor like notepad and wordpress, I plan to increase the amount of features with time hopefully including image support to give it additional functionality. I hope to be able to replace my use of microsoft word and google docs meaning I will likely need a way to convert between the file types as well.

TODO:<br>
    Creating of new files on open<br>
    Add the ability to create additional pages for text if needed<br>
    Change saving method to a keyboard shortcut and button<br>
    Add colour changing options for text<br>
      - will have to change how often the page is updated with the read method<br>
    Add font size options for text<br>
    Add bold and italics options for text<br>
    Add picture adding functionality<br>
    Export to text file, google docs and maybe microsoft word<br>
    <br>
  Cosmetic updates:<br>
    Make the scroll bar actually match everything else<br>
    Improve error messages<br>
    Improve the appearance of buttons on hover effects<br>
    Sound effects on clicks for example<br>
    Add a settings tab with a bunch of colour changing options and other options<br>
    <br>
  Farrrr future features:<br>
    Add support for edditing text files<br>
