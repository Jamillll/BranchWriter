This is a text editor like notepad and wordpress, I plan to increase the amount of features with time hopefully including image support to give it additional functionality. I hope to be able to replace my use of microsoft word and google docs meaning I will likely need a way to convert between the file types as well.

TODO:
  Now:
    Creating of new files on open
    Add the ability to create additional pages for text if needed
    Change saving method to a keyboard shortcut and button
    Add colour changing options for text
      - will have to change how often the page is updated with the read method
    Add font size options for text
    Add bold and italics options for text
    Add picture adding functionality
    Export to text file, google docs and maybe microsoft word
    
  Cosmetics:
    Make the scroll bar actually match everything else
    Improve error messages
    Improve the appearance of buttons on hover effects
    Sound effects on clicks for example
    Add a settings tab with a bunch of colour changing options and other options
    
  Farrrr future:
    Add support for edditing text files
